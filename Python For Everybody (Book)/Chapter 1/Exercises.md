# Python For Everybody Chapter 1 Exercises

### Exercise 1: What is the function of the secondary memory in a computer?
- [ ] Execute all of the computation and logic of the program
- [ ] Retrieve web pages over the internet
- [x] Store information for the long term, even beyond a power cycle
- [ ] Take input from the user

### Exercise 2: What is a program?
- A program is a set of instructions that specify computations

### Exercise 3: What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?
- A compiler translates a program written in a high-level language into a low-level language all at once, in preparation for later executions. An interpret executes a program in a high-level language by translating it one line at a time.

### Exercise 4: Which of the following contains "machine code"?
- [ ] The Python interpreter
- [ ] The keyboard
- [x] Python source file
- [ ] A word processing document

### Exercise 5: What is wrong with the following code:
```
>>> primt 'Hello world!'
File "<stdin>", line 1
    primt 'Hello world!'

SyntaxError: invalid syntax

- The print function is misspelled and is also missing the parentheses ().

### Exercise 6: Where in the computer is a variable such as "x" stored after the following Python line finishes?
```
x = 123
```
- [ ] Central processing unit
- [x] Main Memory
- [ ] Secondary Memory
- [ ] Input Devices
- [ ] Output Devices

### Exercise 7: What will the following program print out:
```
x = 43
x = x - 1
print(x)
```
- [ ] 43
- [x] 42
- [ ] x + 1
- [ ] Error because x = x + 1 is not possible mathematically

### Exercise 8: Explain each of the following using an example of a human capability: 
#### (1) Central Processing Unit
#### (2) Main Memory
#### (3) Seconday Memory
#### (4) Input Device 
#### (5) Output Device

### Exercise 9: How do you fix a "Syntax Error"?
